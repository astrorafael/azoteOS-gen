# AzoteOS-gen

Tool used to create Raspberry Pi AzoteOS images.
Tool forked from the [official pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen) repository.

This fork will build an image based on `Raspberry Pi OS lite`with a few extra software packages 
specifically for the AZOTEA project:
* [`podman`](https://podman.io/) as the container management system
* [`cockpit`](https://cockpit-project.org/) for web based administration
* etc.
